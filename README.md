## `Flax` is renamed to `Melt` Now

`Melt` means `Meta Excellent Local Note System`. ( it may be renamed again ... )

Here is a first cli demo. It just has some basic interface now. it doesn't have 
any real function currently.

This is not a formal release though.

## Part Preview
- the init welcome page(use css framework)

## Is there a demo page to view before i download it?

Yes, it is. Now the blog is not working.

You can View my Blog [Here](https://memorytoco.github.io/Lasga/).
It is purely genereted by **melt** along with some css style and maybe some js.
But i'm not quite familiar with front end so it may be ugly.

> Because the melt is undering a big change, i'm unable to update the blog
